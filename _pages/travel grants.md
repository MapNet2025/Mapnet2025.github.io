## Travel Grants

We are pleased to announce we will be offering both student and early career grants this year.

Early career grants are defined as within 7 years post graduation from last qualification.

To apply please submit a short paragraph about why you wish to attend MapNet and indicate if you are applying for a student or early career grant when submitting an [abstract](https://mapnet2025.github.io/abstracts/).

Travel grants will be awarded based on quality of the abstract and reason for wanting to attend MapNet.

Travel grants close on 5pm 1st October.
