### BLUP Methods Workshop: 10 November, 2025

<!-- This workshop will introduce and go through the statistical methodology of Best Linear Unbiased Prediction, widely used to evaluate genetic merit. The methods pedigree BLUP (pBLUP), genomic BLUP (GBLUP) and single-step genomic BLUP (ssGBLUP) will be covered together with coding examples. DWReml software may also be included, an upcoming free-to-use version of ASReml presented as an R package. -->

This workshop considers the analysis of selection experiments which incorporate ancestral and/or genomic information. The workshop uses real examples taken from plant improvement programs which illustrate fitting a linear mixed model in a (fully-efficient) single-step approach. The freely available R package DWReml (Butler et al., 2025) will be used in the workshop.

A laptop will be required for this workshop.

It will run from 8:45am to 5pm.
