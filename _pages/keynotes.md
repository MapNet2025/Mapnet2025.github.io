## Professor Brian Cullis  
**University of Wollongong**

**_DWREML: a computationally efficient R package for fitting aspirational mixed models in genetic improvement programs_**

Brian Cullis did his undergraduate studies at the University of Sydney, completing a BSc (Hons) in Mathematical Statistics in 1977. In 1987 he obtained his PhD from the University of New South Wales under the supervision of Professor Charles McGilchrist. This then led to his appointment to the Research Scientist classification. He progressed through efficiency barriers and higher levels until 2007 to be one of only three researchers in NSWDPI to be appointed as a Senior Principal Research Scientist. From 1994 he was also Research Leader, Biometrics, whose role was to provide administrative and scientific leadership direction of NSWDPI's biometrics program. Professor Cullis resigned from NSWDPI in 2010 to take an appointment as the inaugural chair in Biometry at the University of Wollongong (UOW). Currently he is a Senior Professor in the School of Mathematics and Applied Statistics. Professor Cullis has published over 200 scientific articles, is a co-developer of the ASReml and DWReml software. Current projects include development of new methodologies for the analysis of large and complex multi-environment trial data-sets, generation of optimal designs for a pre-specified covariance structure and development of efficient algorithms and models for one-stage analysis of genomic data-sets in plants.

## Associate Professor Anna Santure  
**University of Auckland**

**_Leveraging two decades of monitoring to map inbreeding depression in the threatened hihi (stitchbird; Notiomystis cincta)_**

Anna is an Associate Professor at Waipapa Taumata Rau - the University of Auckland. Her team employs genomic data and population and quantitative genetics analyses to understand the potential of populations to adapt to future selection pressures such as anthropogenic climate change. Current projects include understanding the genomic contributions to fitness in the endangered New Zealand hihi (stitchbird) and the impacts of low genetic diversity on the speciesâ€™ adaptive potential, understanding the genomic determinants of invasive success in common myna and common starling.

## Dr Timothy Bilton  
**BSI - AgResearch**

**_A new era of genomic prediction for the primary industries: Genomics for all, phenotyping at scale_**

<img src="../assets/Tim.jpg" alt="Dr Timothy Bilton" width="200" style="border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:10px;" />

Dr. Timothy Bilton is a Senior Statistician at the Bioeconomy Science Institute with particular expertise in the realm of statistical genetics. Timothy holds a PhD from the University of Otago where his thesis was focused on developing statistical methods to account for errors in the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data, and has since had 4 years of experience working in the crown research sector (having held several roles at the predecessor crown research institute AgResearch). Current areas of research for Timothy include developing methods and tools for genomic selection and evaluations, analyzing data related to rumen microbiomes and methane emissions in ruminants, and developing methods and tools for genomic analysis of polyploids.
